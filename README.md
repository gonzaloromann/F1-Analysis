# Formula 1 Data Analysis with AI

## Project Overview
This project seeks to address a detailed analysis of relevant aspects of Formula 1. 
Artificial intelligence models will be used, such as various types of neural networks, natural language analysis models and machine learning models.
 
Therefore, a detailed analysis of data related to the competition will be carried out,
historical results, its circuits and several other aspects that are collected in our database.

## Language
The whole project and python files are written in Spanish. If other language is preferred do not hesitate to reach out to me.

## Technologies Used
- Neural Networks  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Machine Learning Models
- Web Scrapping
- Images Generator 

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on historical Formula 1 data, including race results, circuits, and other relevant competition-related information. 
The data is obtained from the kaggle database "Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2024)" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)  
and scrapping from the Formula 1 subreddit and circuits images

## Objectives
- Identify key patterns and trends in Formula 1.  
- Apply AI techniques to extract valuable insights.  
- Explore different aspects of the competition using advanced data science methods.

## Detailed 
- Feature Importance:
  A sentiment analysis of races from recent seasons is conducted to identify the most influential factors in determining whether a race is entertaining or not.
  
- Current Dominance:
  The probability of being in a new era of dominance in the premier class of motorsport is explored.
  
- Circuit Analysis:
  Potential new circuits are analyzed to predict their performance and characteristics.
  Additionally, Spanish tracks are studied to identify their typical features.
